Google Chrome extension to follow the CS:GO scene

The extension was first created in june 2013. It started out as a way to easily track pro matches in Google Chrome.
After posting to the Global Offensive subreddit (/r/GlobalOffensive) I received a lot of positive feedback and teamed up with someone already working on an extension himself.
His extension had a lot more features and a way nicer layout so we combined forces and this is what we came up with.

The last updates to the old extension were made early june 2013 and the project was abandoned.
On the 8th of july 2015 I started working on the extension again for fun.
